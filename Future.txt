New Designs for ImportINV:
	1. standardize the frontend pygui function
	2. :: several locations
		a. the dirty data
		b. formatted dirty data that can use some love
		c. cleaned data that must try to go to Counterpoint
		d. cleaned data that goes onto cloud
		e. flagged data that is input onto cloud directly
	
	
	
	
	2. maybe try it in react?
