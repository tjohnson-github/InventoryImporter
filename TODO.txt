======================================

List of store editor:
- add new store -- add code
- auto-populate with chosen store

Let ppl change names of any files (nonbatched stage, or process) at any point

















=======================================
OLD

-- Create new staging behaviour:
	1. user chooses input/output folders
	2. user prepares first pass (manualCheck from Importer
		- Allow options to:
			- skip duplicate lines (or combine into single new QTY)
			- enable barcode lookup for items to grab photo URL
		- all checked files go to staged area
	3. program goes into ~waiting~ mode while we do one last physical check (can be killed here, i.e. 'do later': save session details)
		- add new waiting window that recommends doing all sorts of things 
			- minor changes to price/name/dept/
		- add button that pretty much says "CONTINUE"
	4. above Continue button should go to same window as new "Post-Staged" section
		- that is meant to skip over importer step (as stuff can come in at any stage)
	
-- Instead of BOTH have (BOTH (COPY)) and (BOTH (DIVIDE))



-- New Process:
	0. Change Input Folders
	1. import files to stage
		- traditional import step; 
		- files moved out of input into staging
	2. move stage to commit
		- Instantiate FLAGGING process here:
			- products whose name/upc have changed
		- Allow for Options to:
			- directly upload to website (invisible even if have definite qty as needs media)
	3. auto-cleanup
		- files moved out of staging into new output schema?
			- by dept?
			- by
